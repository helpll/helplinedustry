*helpl will not save you*  
***i give up tryna import multicrafter just download it here https://github.com/liplum/MultiCrafterLib/releases/tag/v1.7***  
this mod is very much unfinished, but it is indeed *playable*...  
mod made to be as cursed and annoying to play as possable, every planet will have some sort of gimmick that'll be confusing for people.  
*stuff below will be fixed to be better later*
# planets

*Ithkuilia*: everything is extremely overcomplicated and meant to cause as much annoyance as possible while remaining playable.  
*helplios*: everything is very goofy ahh  
*ma pona*: the opposite of *Ithkuilia*, everything is really simple and straight forward.  
*kitchen sink*(not started): every planet combined

(no other planet ideas are here yet come back later)

# todo

***General***  
testing  
add planet sectiors  

helpl (and DeltaV partially) will make music to replace every ingame track hopefully.  
currently we have menu, editor, game1, and game8 as the finished tracks (we be workin on launch theme).  


***Ithkuilia:***  
im thinking of making each turret and unit require its specific parts (from what i'll call "the part maker")  
^^ also this'll maybe resolve the issue that the other guy had ^^  
finish quijada  
balance new turrets   
add turret tiers (starts at Mk I) (ex. Javelin Mk II or Accost Mk VI) (Mk I Done) (Mk II Done) (Mk III Done)  
add turret tiers Cont (do Mk IV (0/4) (gigachadium turrets)) (do Mk V (ithkuilium turrets))  
implement uranium and crafting volitite and such  
implement launchpad (the item launcher)  
wacky higher tier end game materials   
give steam and hyper steel and stuff a use  
sector idea: you get bombed by offscreen artillery constantly  
add some more air units  
add advanced facilities and also other crafters  
sprites (units and shit)  
more stuff (add items first)
