***i give up tryna import multicrafter just download it here https://github.com/liplum/MultiCrafterLib/releases/tag/v1.7***  
this mod is very much unfinished, but it is indeed *playable*...  
mod made to be as cursed and annoying to play as possable, every planet will have some sort of gimmick that'll be confusing for people.  
*stuff below will be fixed to be better later*
# planets

*Ithkuilia*: everything is extremely overcomplicated and meant to cause as much annoyance as possible while remaining playable.  
*helplios*: everything is very goofy ahh  
*ma pona*: the opposite of *Ithkuilia*, everything is really simple and straight forward.  
*kitchen sink*(not started): every planet combined

(no other planet ideas are here yet come back later)
